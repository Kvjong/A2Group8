I've been living and breathing IT since I was a young child and we had our first computer, a Commodore 64.
I always wanted to work out how they worked, and I was always the one that caught the blame when something went wrong because I was always tinkering, fiddling, and working things out.
When  finished yr12 I went into a course doing Computer forensics, which gave me enough knowledge and experience to jump into an IT support role after I dropped out of the course.
Since that first job in IT, I've worked a lot of positions both in and out of IT, I've studied an Advanced Diploma in Video Game Art and Animation, and generally gained a great appreciation for the diversity and hard work that goes into even the seemingly simple games I play.
Looking to the future I plan to focus on software engineering and programming to finally make my own way in the IT industry.
