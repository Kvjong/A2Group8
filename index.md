- **Samuel Jones - S3828578**

[Assignment 1 Website] <https://vespidis.github.io/> 
>I have always had a personal interest in IT mostly from the perspective of video games, I spent my childhood playing video ames like the Legend of zelda and Banjo Kazooie, and other awesome nintendo games, and I became fascinated with the IT world. However, I never really considered a career in it because I was so focused on becoming an engineer, but I eventually realised that my passion for problem solving could be used and applied in programming and development, and so I taught myself some python, and eventually decided to pursue a career in it because the logic of programming seemed to fit with how I thought and processed the world. I have little to no professional experience in the IT world, but i'm excited to see where this degree takes me.

- **Scott Smith - S3825329**

[Assignment 1 Website] <https://scoot-uni.github.io/Asses1/index.html>
>I have been working in IT since 2007. During that time I have worked as a Network Engineer, Desktop Support Engineer and most recently a Project Manager. Prior to entering the IT industry, I was a member of the Australian Army for almost 8 years.
I am a father of 3 children, who keep me very busy. When I am not spending time with my children, I love to go Mountain Biking. As I live in Canberra, I am very spoilt for places to go riding. 
As I have worked in the IT industry for over 12 years, I realise there are so many opportunites. I am excited to see where this degree
takes me.

- **David Mulgrue - S3824946**

[Assignment 1 Website] <https://S3824946.github.io/S3824946>
>I've been living and breathing IT since I was a young child and we had our first computer, a Commodore 64.
I always wanted to work out how they worked, and I was always the one that caught the blame when something went wrong because I was always tinkering, fiddling, and working things out.
When  finished yr12 I went into a course doing Computer forensics, which gave me enough knowledge and experience to jump into an IT support role after I dropped out of the course.
Since that first job in IT, I've worked a lot of positions both in and out of IT, I've studied an Advanced Diploma in Video Game Art and Animation, and generally gained a great appreciation for the diversity and hard work that goes into even the seemingly simple games I play.
Looking to the future I plan to focus on software engineering and programming to finally make my own way in the IT industry.

### <center> Observations </center>
<p>The biggest over arching factor for our personality test results is that we have a lot in common as a group, combining our strengths but highlighting our weaknesses. Overall, we have a tendency towards both introversion and visual style learning, which means that we may have a hard time getting organised as nobody wishes to take charge, so it will be important for us to have someone be the voice of the group and give direction, though this is a generalisation and we may find that the personalities in the group are more complex than that.  <br><br>
  
Secondly, we are all fairly creative and have a tendency towards visual style learning, which means that in all likelihood the best type of project for our group to do would be one that involves a visual aspect to it, as it will be more likely to be invested in by the entire group.
Lastly, because of our high creativity, we may find that we have clashing visions of what a project, should and could be, so should take care to make sure that each person in the group gets an opportunity to express their personal creative vision for the project.  <br><br>
  
  Finding happy compromises to keep everyone happy will be important, but hopefully that will make us better as a group and allow us to think up innovative and forward-thinking project ideas.

### <center> Jobs </center>


| Samuel Jones | Jacob Smith | Kim Ve Jong | Scott Smith | David Mulgrue |
|:------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| Software Dev | Systems Analyst | Policy Analyst | Desktop Team Leader | iOs Engineer |
                                                                    

### <center> Observations </center>

<p>Though we have some minor career goals in common, our group could actually make up a minor IT department in a company, we have aspiring back-end developers, policy analysts, desktop managers, ui/app developers and a systems analyst to keep everything in working order!
This goes to show how varied the scope of an "IT" Career is, and how many potential opportunities can come from developing this skillset!<br>
Though one thing to note is that the majority of our group do not wish to be "front-facing" this actually lines up quite well with how our personality results went from earlier, as the same majority are classified as introverts.<br>
Samuel, Kim and David are development/back-end focused, where Jacob and Scott are more systems or front facing roles.
