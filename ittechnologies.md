### <center>Cloud Services and Servers</center> 
Cloud computing is the delivery (or offering) of various computing services i.e. Databases, servers, storage, networking, and software over the internet.<br>
Cloud computing has been a buzz word for a few years now, many organizations and individuals have transitioned their traditional services into the “cloud”. The first advantage of using cloud services that comes to mind is the flexibility and scalability of resources. Secondly, with cloud services, you only pay for what you use, so immediate savings can bee seen. You don’t have to build your own data centre and fill it with your own infrastructure.<br>
Most companies are simply not in a position to go out and purchase land, build a data centre, purchase infrastructure, hire people to configure and install the aforementioned equipment. Then, after everything is up and running, they will need to man the data centre and sustain the infrastructure. By utilizing cloud services, they simply rent to access anything from a few applications terabytes of storage from a cloud service provider.<br>
Apart from large companies, individual users are also able to rent cloud services. People and companies can rent simple storage solutions, networking and virtual computers through to high end processing power and massive storage that will run artificial intelligence platforms. Another advantage of cloud services are you are able to run any application or service that you don’t need to be physically co-located with. Your cloud services may be physically located in Belgium, and you may be located in Dubbo NSW.
 As technology advances, network transmission speeds increase and that is being passed on by network service providers. Unless you’re in Australia where the National Broadband Network (NBN) has not kept up standard or speed with the rest of the world. Large businesses that are transferring and processing large amounts of data cannot afford to be left behind and they need to adopt the evolving technologies to stay ahead of the competitors. Cisco are offering up 400gb speeds on their Nexus 9000 series switches. With that amount of bandwidth, massive amounts of data can be moved around in a quick fashion.<br><br>
 Microsoft Office 365 is very popular cloud-based service that is available individuals through to large companies. Microsoft offer a web-based portal providing access to applications like Excel, Word, PowerPoint, OneNote, OneDrive and many others. For very little cost, people are able to use these applications without having to download the application to their machine, all of the information is saved offsite (providing redundancy) and allows the user to access their data from anywhere in the world.<br>
 With the ever-increasing demand for cloud services, vendors had to come up with a solution to address emerging latency and bandwidth issues. One solution was to offload some processing tasks done by the CPU and pass that to the network infrastructure. An example is: In the Data centre environment the Network interface Card needs to a SmartNIC, passing some processing tasks that would usually be completed by the CPU.  SmartNICs can perform network-intensive functions such as encryption/decryption, firewall, TCP/IP, and HTTP processing.<br><br>
 To increase the speed and efficiency of the data centers, more and more sharing of resources will need to occur. Utilising SmartNICs, servers running Graphics Processing Units (to provide resources to virtual machines). There will be further progression in the structured cabling space too. Having the fastest processor, with the fastest Network Interface Card is very useless if the data is only running over standard Cat5e copper cabling. Data centre structure cabling provides connections between devices utilising Optic Fibre. With advances in this infrastructure space, we will see faster transfer speeds resulting in higher bandwidth. NICs with a higher bandwidth capacity will be a flow on of higher transfer speeds.<br>
 With more and more people wanting to access and utilise cloud services, there will be a greater requirement for edge or access layer network architecture. These edge nodes or some people are calling them mini data centres will be required to assist in processes the additional data. They will need to synch up with their central data centre and more than likely need to be interconnected with one another. There will be increased employment opportunities for many industries:<br>
 
-	People that specialise in optic fibre installation.
-	Builders required for building new data centres or refurbish existing building to be re-fit as data centres.
-	Electricians, there will be a massive increase in power demands for a data centre. So not only data centre electricians, but substations will need to be taken into consideration.
-	Air Conditioners installers. Data centres require a large amount of cooling in order to keep the infrastructure at the desired operating temperature.
-	Network Engineers. The basis of any data centre is a good network. These engineers will be required for ongoing sustainment too.
-	Virtual Machine/server engineers. Thick client desktops are slowly becoming a thing of the past.
-	Project Managers. Depending on the size of the data centre, there will be a need for a project management team to facilitate the install and sustainment.


 An increase in Data Centres across the world will have a large impact on the environment. Care must be taken to minimise any short or long term damage to the environment. Using recycled building materials, the installation of solar panels, planting of additional trees, and recycled filtered water for system cooling are all examples that will help to minimise the impact on the environment. With the installation of more cloud services, there will be an impact on other parts of the IT industry. There will be less demand for desktop engineers. Users will be utilising either Thin clients or something on a BYOD platform. 
 
Up until about a year ago, I was a strong advocate for applications installed on my PC or Laptop. Not utilising cloud based much at all. I worked in an environment where security was paramount and traditional cloud services (Amazon, Office 365) were not an option. It wasn’t a foreign concept to me, it simply didn’t get exposed to the mainstream cloud services (like Office 365) in my personal life. Another consideration I had was security. I only had the one machine, I knew that machine was secure. If anyone had accessed my information, it was both my fault and my problem. So, I kept all of my data local, backed up with redundancy. 
Within the last year, I changed employers, security was less of a focus and they utilised Office 365. Due to a change of personal circumstances, I found myself travelling most weekends to visit family. There were plenty of occasions where I wanted to access a document that I thought was residing my laptop, but in fact it was sitting on my PC located 2 hours away in the “My Documents” folder. I initially used to email various documents to myself, however I was having version control issues. I was losing track of when I updated the document and if it was the latest version. I also started at my new workplace, that would throw in another computer to “lose” files on. Where was the latest version of that file I was after? Work, home or laptop. Enter Microsoft’s “One Drive” cloud storage solution.
“Automatic backup for your Desktop, Documents, and Pictures folders
Saving files to the cloud is now effortless. Just set up PC folder backup for any of the three PC folders and OneDrive will do the rest by automatically syncing any changes made or new files added to your backed up folders.”  - https://onedrive.live.com/about/pc-folder-backup/
The cloud service is free for users that only require less than 5GB of storage. Whilst it marketed as an automatic backup solution, I tend to not use OneDrive for that use. I simply use it as a Cloud Storage ‘my documents” folder. That solves my access issues as well as my version control problem.
 
Almost 2 years ago I separated from my wife and as a result my 3 children aged 15 13 and 9 relocated around 2 hours drive from me. Whilst I only see my children every second weekend, my 2 older children and myself use Snapchat to keep in touch. Snapchat is a multimedia mobile app that allows my children and I to send videos, pictures to one another.  My eldest daughter is by far the biggest user of Snapchat, she has daily correspondence with hundreds of her friends. The advantage for my daughter using Snapchat Cloud service is, that the images are not stored locally. She sends hundreds of pictures a day on Snapchat, most are photos of nothing (please don’t ask, it’s a teenager Snapchat thing), if she was required to take a photo and then send it, she would have to go through her phone daily and purge the unwanted photos.
With Technology moving forward, bandwidth increasing and with more Data centres being built there will be an increased availability of types of services. As my children and I use mobile phones for the Snapchat application, I am hoping with advancing technologies there will be better coverage. With better coverage I believe there will be greater bandwidth to communicate easier and faster. Being able to communicate all the time, no matter where we are is very important to us, as we do not live together.
