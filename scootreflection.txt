Group Reflection
I have worked in many teams in my career, made up of people from various backgrounds and cultures. This is the first time that I have worked in a team of people that I haven’t met. As we are only a couple of days out from submission date, overall, I feel that our team has worked quite well together. We were off to a “shaky” start due to the Christmas period and most of us working different jobs, particularly those that work in a shift work environment.
We initially tried to do voice discord chats, that didn’t work out well due to the aforementioned reasons. So, we ended up using Discord text chat which was a far better solution, people could reply when they had a chance. Once we had our communication sorted, tasks were assigned, and we were able work within our own time for overall compilation later. We could have improved by communicating earlier.
Once thing that was surprising (but not bad) we had a new member join our team only 6 days out from submission. The member was having problems communicating with his own team, so we felt we were in a position to help him.
One thing about groups, every person has their own ‘pros and cons’ communication is key. You can’t rush things, everyone has their own busy schedule.
