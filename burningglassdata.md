### Ideal Jobs - Group's Core Skill Requirements


<p>Based on our group’s desired career choice and our ideal paths that we all want to forge, we have identified our group’s core requirement:<br> </p>
- Communication
- Problem Solving Skills
- Analytical Skils
- Time Management

<p>We all need to possess these core skills and do really well to succeed in our chosen career path, as these skills will be assessed, analysed, being judged upon, and form the basis of an impression. These four skills when forming a team for collaboration is a definite must, as failing to do so will ultimately break down, nothing gets done and over budget to cover these shortfalls. The team will also get disgruntled, for example, the group or a member of the group has poor time management skills and ultimately the project has not been completed by the scheduled time, and well, leave it to the (ether, it will sort itself out (the marker will sort it out!!)). Contrary to this notion, if the group embraces these four core skills, it is a recipe for success. <br><br>


However, each of our group members also has a unique subset skill that is suitable and curated for their role more specifically. They are:
</p>

- Presentation Skills
<p>Samuel Jones – A unique set of subset skills required for the ideal job. This is very important because presentation in terms of powerpoint slides, dress code and grooming will set an impression, including an impression of the work. Even the way Samuel codes will need to have a proper structured coding that makes much more readable and not look like spaghetti style coding. So presentation skills for Samuel is a must.</p>

- Multi-Tasking
<p>Jacob Smith – The role of Information systems analyst may need to wear a different hat here and there, by the project being analysed. There may be multiple projects happening at the same time and applying efficiency by using a suite of applications for tracking, analysing, estimate, costing, resources and much more indeed does require multitasking and delegation. An example of  requiring the knowledge of lean six sigma is a testament to the importance of multitasking.</p>
