>I have always had a personal interest in IT mostly from the perspective of video games, I spent my childhood playing video ames like the Legend of zelda and Banjo Kazooie, and other awesome nintendo games, and I became fascinated with the IT world. However, I never really considered a career in it because I was so focused on becoming an engineer, but I eventually realised that my passion for problem solving could be used and applied in programming and development, and so I taught myself some python, and eventually decided to pursue a career in it because the logic of programming seemed to fit with how I thought and processed the world. I have little to no professional experience in the IT world, but i'm excited to see where this degree takes me.

>I have been working in IT since 2007. During that time I have worked as a Network Engineer, Desktop Support Engineer and most recently a Project Manager. Prior to entering the IT industry, I was a member of the Australian Army for almost 8 years.
I am a father of 3 children, who keep me very busy. When I am not spending time with my children, I love to go Mountain Biking. As I live in Canberra, I am very spoilt for places to go riding. 
As I have worked in the IT industry for over 12 years, I realise there are so many opportunites. I am excited to see where this degree
takes me.
