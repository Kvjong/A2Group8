Group reflection done by Jacob Smith
In this group refelection we will be talking about allot of things about the assignment and how well things went, 
If anything could be improved , something that was surprising, something that I learnt about groups, 
How well  you think your github log if activity reflects your group’s work on this assignment
I think we did really well compiling data as a group. If anything could be improved it would be working on communication. 
The most surprising thing was how well all come up with ideas that contributes to the group.  
Something that I learnt about groups is some people don’t respond to messages and talk to you about the group assignments. 
Sam has 94 commmits to the github page, Kim has 15 commits to the github page, scoot has 4 commits to the github page, 
I have 2 commits to the github page. I think  this data is very accurate in compiling data. Overall I think everyone has put in 100% effort
 except for the 2 guys who wished not to participate, but all in all we did pretty well at compiling data and transferring it from whether 
its word doc or text document into the website.
