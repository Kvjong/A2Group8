### What kind of work is done by the IT professional

Desktop Support Engineer. Contractor to the Department of Defence Since 2010.
As part of the Endpoint Services team, I am responsible for level 2 and level 3 support. That can involve the following:
-	Replacing faulty devices; Mice, keyboards, monitors, KVM (Keyboard Video Mouse) switch boxes
-	Relocating machines and equipment due to staff movements 
-	Running of Fibre Optic cable (fly leads)
-	Patching of endpoints into the access layer switch
-	Configuration of switch ports
-	Troubleshooting of 802.1x Security protocol issues (which are quite common due to failing/expiring security certificates)
-	Troubleshooting of Active Directory issues (expired computer accounts)
-	Configuration of System Centre Configuration Manager (pre-stage machines prior to the build/image process)
-	Liaising with other teams in order to resolve submitted tickets.


### What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?


My clients/customers are Department of Defence Public servants and contractors. The organisation is spread across the world and my work can vary from simply replacing a keyboard on a desk located just down the hallway. Or it can involve sending a new machine to the other side of the world and guiding a person through the process of how to connect the cables and how to put the machine on the network. <br><br>
Other people I deal with on a daily basis are other IT professionals. In my current organisation, the IT teams are setup in a very siloed arrangement. That means that my team is responsible for only a certain part of the IT environment. If troubleshooting an issue with machine, my team can check the physical parts that may be faulty. For example, we can check for broken fibre, faulty media converters, basic switch configuration. If the problem persists, we may need to liaise with the Network team to get a larger Subnet created. 


### Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?

Due to my role, I am very lucky that I am not stuck at my desk all day. Once I have received a job ticket in my queue, I may have to go to the workshop in order to get a replacement part. Then I would go to the client and resolve the issue. Another example is, if there was a requirement for a machine refresh, a fair amount of time would be spent by the team in the workshop on a "build bench" imaging/building machine after machine. <br><br>
There are also times, when a member of my team is required to travel interstate or internationally in order to do a complete site refresh. 
This can be a nice change of environment, however the tempo of the work can be quite high, as only a certain amount of time is allocated to 
completing the work due to travel constraints.


### What aspect of their position is most challengning?

Managing customer expectations. One of the things I have learnt from my time in IT, there are a certain amount of people that think they are the most important person in the world. This particular attitude comes from Senior Executive Service Band 3's down to an apprentice that has worked in the organisation for a week. Whilst I do acknowledge that people do have important work to do, it also comes down to priorities. I am unable to drop what I am doing, just because another person failed to plan. A good example is, I have a new starter coming into work tomorrow and their machine isn’t working. I can guarantee that person failed to plan ahead and ensure there was a working terminal with less than a days’ notice. 

Shiny things. Recently our department received a shipment of new monitors. These new monitors were 27 inch and the existing fleet was 24 inch. We received a job to replace a faulty monitor and that was being replaced due to a power issue. Then all of a sudden, we received more tickets/jobs/requests from people located near that first faulty monitor. Turns out there was nothing wrong with their monitors, they simply wanted the new monitors. They saw something shiny and they wanted it to. It happens a lot. However, due to budget constraints, we are unable to replace monitors if there is nothing wrong with them.
